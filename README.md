**Few FAQ's :**

Q: Why should a client meet the lawyer through your website not personally? 
Ans: We are not restricting the clients to not meet the lawyers. But our website is a first handbook for clients to filter the lawyers for them. And also say the client is from Bangalore but he has a case in Delhi , but he has to contact many of the clients in order to know about the lawyer in Delhi. So this provides the review system and the success rate in giffy for the clients to look upon.
